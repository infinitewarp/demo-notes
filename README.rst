Just a bunch of one-off scripts and notes I use for demoing code I'm working on.


runnable demos
--------------

Some of the more recent demos are actually `demo-magic <https://github.com/infinitewarp/demo-magic>`_ scripts.

.. code-block:: sh

    brew install pv
    wget -O ~/bin/demo-magic.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infinitewarp/demo-magic/master/demo-magic.sh


They might also require `toilet ðŸš½ <http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/toilet>`_. Not to be confused with `figlet <http://www.figlet.org/>`_.

.. code-block:: sh

    brew install toilet
